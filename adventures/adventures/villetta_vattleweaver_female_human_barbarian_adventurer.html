                <h2>Rage</h2>
                <p>A barbarian can fly into a rage a certain number of times per day, increasing their strength,
                    constitution, and melee damage output.</p>
                <p><b>Rules:</b> A barbarian can use the Rage ability twice per long rest, starting at level 1. While
                    raging, they gain advantage on Strength checks and saving throws, take half damage from physical
                    attacks, and deal an extra 2 damage with melee weapon attacks. Rage lasts for 1 minute, ending early
                    if the barbarian is knocked unconscious, their turn ends and they haven't attacked a hostile
                    creature since their last turn, or if they choose to end it early as a bonus action.</p>

                    Constitution modifier, while not wearing armor or using a shield. This feature improves as they
                    level up.</p>

                <p>A barbarian's critical hits with melee attacks deal additional damage.</p>
                <p><b>Rules:</b> Starting at level 9, when a barbarian scores a critical hit with a melee weapon attack,
                    they roll one additional weapon damage die and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit. This
                    feature improves at higher levels.</p>

                <p><b>Rules:</b> Starting at level 2, a barbarian can choose to make their melee weapon attacks with
                    advantage on their turn, but all attacks against them have advantage until the start of their next

                    bear, eagle, or wolf. Each spirit grants the barbarian additional abilities and bonuses while

            Barbarian Training Lore
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary">
            <div class="story-block speakToMeNow">
                The history of barbarian training can be traced back to the earliest days of civilization. In many
                cultures, young warriors were trained from an early age to hone their fighting skills and become fierce
                defenders of their tribe or clan.
            </div>
            <div class="story-block speakToMeNow">
                The training methods of barbarians varied from culture to culture, but they all shared a common emphasis
                on physical strength and endurance. Often, young warriors were put through grueling physical tests and
                forced to endure extreme hardships to toughen them up for battle.
            </div>
            <div class="story-block speakToMeNow">
                In some cultures, barbarians were revered for their strength and bravery, and their training was
                considered a sacred duty. In others, they were viewed as savage and uncivilized, and their training was
                seen as a necessary evil to protect the community from outside threats.
            </div>
            <div class="story-block speakToMeNow">
                As civilization progressed and technology advanced, the role of the barbarian changed. While they were
                once the primary defenders of their people, they now found themselves in a world where their skills were
                less in demand. Many turned to mercenary work, selling their services as fighters for hire to the
                highest bidder.
            </div>
            <div class="story-block speakToMeNow">
                Despite their changing role, barbarian training remained an important part of many cultures. Even in the
                modern world, where magic and technology have changed the face of warfare, there are still those who
                believe that the old ways of the barbarian hold value and should be preserved.

                <p>Villetta Battleweaver is a slow-to-trust individual who has lost too many friends and is therefore
                    slow to make new ones. She speaks slowly when talking to people she considers to be idiots, which,
                    compared to her, is almost everyone. Despite this, Villetta is a lawful good soldier who fights for
                    those who cannot fight for themselves. Her bond is with her people, and she considers her city,
                    nation, or people to be all that matter. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="story-block speakToMeNow">
                <p> Villetta's characteristic is that she is very cleanly dressed. However, her flaw is that the
                    monstrous enemy she faced in battle still leaves her quivering with fear. Her talent lies in solving
                    puzzles, and she is great at it. Villetta also has a funny accent and is quite obnoxious in her
                    mannerisms. </p>

            Being a teamster
        </div>
        <div class="burgSummary">
            <div class="story-block speakToMeNow">
                <p>Villetta had always been fascinated by the workings of the teamster guild in her town. As one of the
                    lead members, she oversaw the transport of goods from the mines to the markets, ensuring that the
                    valuable resources were delivered safely and efficiently.</p>
                <p>Her day started early in the morning as she led a team of workers to harness the animals, making sure
                    the horses and oxen were well-fed and cared for. She inspected the carts and wagons, ensuring that
                    they were in good working condition and that the drivers were ready for the long journey ahead.</p>
                <p>As they set off, Villetta would keep a close eye on the progress of the caravan, making sure that
                    they were not attacked by bandits or wild animals. She kept a close watch on the supplies, making
                    sure that they were not damaged or stolen during the journey.</p>
                <p>When they arrived at the mines, Villetta oversaw the loading of the carts and wagons, making sure
                    that everything was packed correctly and that the load was distributed evenly. She also managed the
                    teamsters and made sure that they were paid fairly and on time.</p>
                <p>Villetta enjoyed the challenge of resource management for a large resource town with valuable mines.
                    She oversaw the distribution of the resources, making sure that everyone got their fair share. She
                    also helped to manage the magical ship gates and water mills that powered the rock crushing machines
                    in the hills.</p>
                <p>Despite being content with her position in the guild, Villetta longed for adventure in the wilds. She
                    admired the barbarian training and wanted to experience it for herself. She had heard tales of the
                    magical wagons that could travel through the wilderness without the need for pack animals, and she
                    was eager to try them out.</p>
                <p>Villetta knew that there were risks to being a teamster, but she also knew that the rewards were
                    worth it. She was proud of the economic value that her guild brought to the town, and she was
                    excited to continue leading them into the future.</p>

                    Villetta was on the road, leading a caravan of wagons filled with grain, with her husband Jacquelin
                    and son Knox by her side. Suddenly, a giant appeared on the path ahead, towering over them and
                    looking hungry.

                <div class="story-block speakToMeNow">
                    Knox, being a druid, started to talk to the giant, telling it about all the good mushrooms in the
                    area that it could eat instead of attacking them. Surprisingly, the giant seemed to be listening and
                    was even starting to warm up to Knox.

                    Just as they thought they had made a new friend, a group of guards rode up on horseback, armed and
                    ready to fight the giant. Startled by their sudden appearance, the giant lashed out and knocked Knox
                    over, causing Villetta to panic.

                <div class="story-block speakToMeNow">
                    In the end, they were able to calm the situation down and it turned out that the giant was just
                    hungry and looking for food. They gave it some of their extra grain and continued on their way,
                    still replaying the encounter in their heads.

                        Surrendering means they give up the fight and are at the mercy of their enemies. Depending on

                        the heat of battle, and the clock is ticking. Every move you make counts. You have one minute to
                        play your action card or write down your action. Time is precious, and the stakes are high. Will
                        you succeed?</p>

                        pause the timer, but try to keep the adrenaline pumping. Once the timer is up, or everyone has
                        finished, roll all the dice you need for your action. Take note of what rolls you would use in
                        different conditions. This is where the real fun begins.</p>
                    <p>Everyone rolls dice to hit, deal damage, and make three ordered saving throws to be used in the
                        order of action. Everything happens at the same time, all players and the DM. Then, evaluate
                        everything in the order of initiative, and it can't be changed. Reactions must be played before
                        the next action is evaluated. Tap twice on the table to show you're ready for the next
                        round. </p>
                    <p>But remember, if you don't make it in time, no action. So, be brave, be bold, and make every move
